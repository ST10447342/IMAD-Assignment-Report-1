# IMAD-Assignment-Report-1

Introduction

I created a project that will display historical figures based on the users age and i made the application look as neat as possible which also includes the code, and with this report i will go step to step on how i accomplished this with the application.

First i started by creating a new project, when the project was created i looked at the design in my activity_main.xml and started with the design of my user interface, i put a textview in the middle of the page and put it in ontop of the page and i named the the textview "Welcome To Historio The App" after that i put constraints on the textview. Underneath the textview i put a number plain text with that number plain text i put constraints on it and put an ID on it, i ID'd the plain text "etAge", after finishing my number plain text i added buttons

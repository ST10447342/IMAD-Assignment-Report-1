# IMAD-Assignment-Report-1

Introduction

I created a project that will display historical figures based on the users age and i made the application look as neat as possible which also includes the code, and with this report i will go step to step on how i accomplished this with the application.

First i started by creating a new project, when the project was created i looked at the design in my activity_main.xml and started with the design of my user interface, i put a textview in the middle of the page and put it in ontop of the page and i named the the textview "Welcome To Historio The App" after that i put constraints on the textview. Underneath the textview i added a plain text where the user must input their name i added constraints deleted the text added a hint with the color black after the name plain text i put a number plain text, with that number plain text i put constraints on it took out the text and added a hint that says Age and with the hint color as black and put an ID on it, i ID'd the plain text "etAge", after finishing my Number and Name plain text i added buttons underneath the number plain text, i added ID's on both of these buttons and named the buttons "Clear" and "Generate" the generate button role is show the historical figures and clear button must the age of the user, once i finished adding the buttons underneath the button i added a textview that will show the historical figure information once you press the button "Generate" and the user will get their information.

When i finished my design for my user interface i went into the coding part of the application, i went to the MainActivity.kt of the application and started adding my declarations such as the information i put on my interface that will be needed for the application to work, so i added the first declaration which is the age plain text that is in the user interface, i added the ID of the age plain text then pressed space equals sign then typed something that finds and identifies if the ID of the age exists then i pressed "enter" on my keyboards twice and the started adding my buttons declarations, after i pressed enter twice i typed the ID for my buttons pressed space and put the equals sign and something that identifies if the ID of my buttons exist, then i pressed "enter" twice on keyboard and started adding the ID of where the information will be displayed when you press "Generate", started typing the ID of the results of the textview then i pressed space and then put equals sign space again then typed something that identifies if the ID of my results exist.

Once i got done with my declarations i started typing to make my "Clear" button work after i finished typing the code i went to onto my "Generate" button and started making code for it. I added the code by making the results into a string after making the results into a string i typed a function that would make the app show the historical figure when the users put in their age and press the button "Generate" and the results will show the users their historical figure that was based off their age, the function is the IF function this function should be easy to use if you are a programmer, it is not hard to understand if your used to working on your codes and i used one these functions which took alot of my time since i typed in quite abit of historical figures on my code, once i finished my long list of IF function code, i typed a small piece of code underneath the IF function code that small bit of code should
should show the user historical figures. I finished the the coding of the app now i had to run the app which i did, and the app was running perfectly i saw it was running perfectly because i entered my name and an invalid age and the app told me that i entered an invalid value, it basically showed me an error message which is what i needed to know which tells me that i did an amazing job on the coding, also it showed the historical figures once i entered an age within the range i put into my code, so finished the main point of the app.

Since i finished the coding part of the app, i now had to make the user interface look appropriate for my users i went to add background image for my user interface and include font onto my app to make it look more like an app rather than a bland app, so i went to do the background image of my app first and to do that i went to chrome, and searched for a historic image and looked for a image that would be appropriate for my users to see and to see if i felt it was valid for it to be a background image within my app, once i found my image i went to project and went and pressed and right clicked on "res" and pasted my image, after i pasted the image i went to add it onto the user interface background by putting a code into the activity_main.xml, once i did that i went onto putting fonts on my app, i went to google font and looked for a font that was simple but not to bland for my app once i found i wanted i copied it and went back to my app and went to project and right clicked on "res" went to New pressed Android Resource Depository and named my new depository "font" within my new depository i pasted my google font within the depository, i then added a piece of code to values within the user interface that i thought needed the font i found on google and with all that i completed putting in a font in my app.
